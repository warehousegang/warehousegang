# About Me

Platform & Reliability Engineering leader focused on building cloud-native delivery systems, Terraform-driven infrastructure, resilient Kubernetes workloads, and automated CI/CD platforms. I work at the intersection of Platform Engineering, SRE, and Quality, designing systems that are observable, reproducible, and safe to deploy at scale.

My background spans AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, observability, GitHub Actions, distributed testing platform, and end-to-end reliability engineering. I build infrastructure and automation that reduce operational burden and increase development velocity.

I’m currently developing a portfolio of open-source reference implementations showcasing platform engineering patterns, IaC architectures, Kubernetes platform design, and cloud-native automation workflows.

## Technical Focus
* **Cloud Architecture:** AWS compute platforms (ECS/EKS), VPC design, IAM, event-driven systems, operational telemetry
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform module ecosystems, reusable blueprints, multi-environment automation
* **CI/CD Architecture:** GitHub Actions platforms, container-native pipelines, deployment automation at scale
* **Kubernetes Platform Engineering:** Cluster architecture, multi-namespace design, workload orchestration, scaling strategies
* **Reliability Engineering:** SLO/SLI governance, metrics/logging architecture, observability systems, operational excellence
* **Test Platform Engineering:** Distributed test execution, Playwright/Pytest integration, pipeline-driven validation systems for QE teams.
* **AI Reliability:** Dataset pipelines, evaluation frameworks, LLM behavior validation and guardrail checks (Bedrock)

## **What I’m Working On**
### Platform Engineering Starter Kit (Active WIP)
A complete starter kit for Infrastructure-as-Code–driven platform provisioning, including Terraform modules, ECS/ECR service templates, CloudWatch logging integrations, and GitHub Actions pipelines with OIDC authentication.
Serves as a foundation for teams moving toward modern platform engineering practices.

### Platform Reference Architecture 
A production-grade reference architecture for building cloud-native platforms on AWS using Terraform, EKS/ECS, GitHub Actions, and modern observability practices.

### Kubernetes Observability Stack 
Complete Kubernetes observability platform built with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager, Tempo, and OpenTelemetry. Provides metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and alerting rules for deep visibility into containerized systems.

### Incident Response Handbook
A practical, production-ready handbook defining incident response workflows, escalation paths, communication patterns, postmortem structures, severity taxonomies, and operational readiness processes.

### Reliability Engineering Patterns
A curated library of production-ready templates for designing observable, resilient, and scalable systems.
Covers deployment strategies, DR patterns, telemetry configurations, and best-practice reliability engineering components.

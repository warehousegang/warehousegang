# About Me

Platform & Reliability Engineering leader focused on building cloud-native delivery systems, Terraform-driven infrastructure, resilient Kubernetes workloads, and automated CI/CD platforms. I work at the intersection of Platform Engineering, SRE, and Quality—designing systems that are observable, reproducible, and safe to deploy at scale.

My background spans AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, distributed testing platforms, Playwright, and end-to-end reliability engineering. I build infrastructure and automation that reduce operational burden and increase development velocity.

I’m currently developing a portfolio of open-source reference implementations showcasing platform engineering patterns, IaC architectures, Kubernetes platform design, and cloud-native automation workflows.

## Technical Focus
* Cloud Architecture: AWS compute platforms (ECS/EKS), VPC design, IAM, event-driven systems, operational telemetry
* Infrastructure as Code: Terraform module ecosystems, reusable blueprints, multi-environment automation
* CI/CD Architecture: GitHub Actions platforms, container-native pipelines, deployment automation at scale
* Kubernetes Platform Engineering: Cluster architecture, multi-namespace design, workload orchestration, scaling strategies
* Reliability Engineering: SLO/SLI governance, metrics/logging architecture, observability systems, operational excellence
* Test Platform Engineering: Distributed test execution, Playwright/Pytest integration, pipeline-driven validation systems
* AI Reliability: Dataset pipelines, evaluation frameworks, LLM behavior validation and guardrail checks (Bedrock)

## Featured Projects
### Platform Reference Architecture 
A production-grade reference architecture for building cloud-native platforms on AWS using Terraform, EKS/ECS, GitHub Actions, and modern observability practices.
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/platform-reference-architecture 

### Kubernetes Observability Stack 
Complete Kubernetes observability platform built with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager, Tempo, and OpenTelemetry. Provides metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and alerting rules for deep visibility into containerized systems.
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/k8s-observability-stack 

### Platform Engineering Starter Kit 
Reference architecture for IaC-driven platform provisioning using Terraform, AWS ECS/ECR, CloudWatch logging, IAM roles, and GitHub Actions pipelines.  
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/platform-engineering-starter-kit

### Reliability Reference Architecture 
A complete reference architecture for multi-AZ design, networking, CI/CD, data layer HA, observability stacks, and service mesh patterns.  
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/reliability-reference-architecture

## What I’m Working On

* Building open-source reference implementations for platform engineering and reliability systems
* Enhancing IaC and Kubernetes patterns across personal projects
* Developing cloud-native automation workflows and test orchestration examples

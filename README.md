## **About Me**

**Director of Quality Engineering** focused on building **automation-first, platform-scale quality systems** for complex SaaS and regulated environments.

I design and lead **test automation platforms**, **CI/CD quality gates**, and **cloud-based QA infrastructure** that enable teams to ship faster without sacrificing release confidence. My work spans **Playwright-based test systems**, **distributed test execution**, **AWS-hosted QA platforms**, and **AI-assisted testing frameworks**.

At Snap eHealth, I built modern **Quality Engineering platforms** from the ground up — including a large-scale **AI testing system** with **quality oracles** and a **scenario factory validating 50,000+ prompt cases** — and led the transformation from **manual QA to risk-based, pipeline-integrated Quality Engineering**.

This GitHub serves as a **portfolio of reference implementations** demonstrating how modern **Quality Engineering organizations** build scalable, maintainable test systems and quality infrastructure in the cloud.

## **Technical Focus**

- **Quality Engineering Leadership:** Automation-first strategy, risk-based testing, release readiness, quality metrics  
- **Test Automation Platforms:** Playwright, Pytest, large-scale distributed test execution  
- **CI/CD Quality Architecture:** Pipeline-integrated validation, automated quality gates, artifact-driven workflows  
- **Cloud-Based QA Infrastructure:** AWS (ECS/ECR, IAM, CloudWatch), Docker, Terraform  
- **AI-Assisted Testing:** Scenario generation, quality oracles, regression evaluation, guardrail validation  
- **Regulated Software Quality:** Audit-ready workflows, compliance-aligned release processes

## **What I’m Building**

### **Quality Engineering Platform Reference Kits**
Production-grade reference implementations for building **QE-owned automation platforms** using Terraform, containerized test runners, and CI/CD-driven validation pipelines.

### **Distributed Test Execution Frameworks**
Scalable test execution systems supporting **parallel Playwright and Pytest workloads**, optimized for **signal quality** and **fast feedback**.

### **AI Testing & Evaluation Systems**
Frameworks for validating **AI-assisted features** using **scenario factories**, **automated oracles**, and **repeatable regression testing**.

### **Incident & Release Readiness Playbooks**
Practical templates for **quality-driven release decisions**, defect triage, and production readiness reviews.

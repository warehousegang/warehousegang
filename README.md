# About Me

Platform and Reliability Engineering leader with experience building cloud-native delivery systems, Terraform-based infrastructure, containerized workloads, and automated CI/CD pipelines. I work at the intersection of Platform Engineering, SRE, and Quality, designing systems that are observable, reproducible, and safe to deploy at scale.
Strong background in AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Playwright, GitHub Actions, distributed test platforms, and reliability-focused engineering.

Currently developing a portfolio of open-source examples illustrating platform engineering patterns, IaC, Kubernetes workloads, and cloud-native automation.
## Technical Focus

* Cloud Infrastructure: AWS (ECS, EKS, VPC, IAM, EventBridge, CloudWatch)
* Infrastructure as Code: Terraform (modules, environments, automated provisioning)
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions, containerized pipelines, artifact workflows
* Kubernetes: workload orchestration, namespaces, jobs, cluster configuration
* Reliability: SLO/SLI design, observability patterns, metrics, logging architectures
* Test Platforms: Playwright, Pytest, distributed browser execution
* AI Quality: dataset generation, evaluation pipelines, LLM model checks (Bedrock)

## Featured Projects

### Playwright on EKS (In DEV)
Terraform + Kubernetes example for running Playwright tests on an AWS EKS cluster.  
Repo: [https://github.com/trafik255/playwright-on-eks](https://github.com/trafik255/playwright-eks)

### Platform Engineering Starter Repo (TESTING)
Reference architecture for IaC-driven platform provisioning using Terraform, AWS ECS/ECR, CloudWatch logging, IAM roles, and GitHub Actions pipelines.  
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/platform-engineering-starter-kit

### Reliability Engineering Patterns (In DEV)
A curated library of patterns for availability, resilience, scalability, observability, deployments, and security. Includes examples in Terraform, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions.  
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/reliability-engineering-patterns

### Incident Response Handbook (In DEV)
A practical framework for on-call operations, severity models, escalation paths, communication playbooks, runbooks, SLIs/SLOs, and postmortem standards.  
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/incident-response-handbook

### Reliability Reference Architecture (In DEV)
A complete reference architecture for multi-AZ design, networking, CI/CD, data layer HA, observability stacks, and service mesh patterns.  
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/reliability-reference-architecture

### QE-AI Framework (In DEV)
Tools for LLM evaluation, guardrails, goldset/red-team dataset generation, scoring logic, and automated validation using AWS Bedrock models.  
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/qa-ai-lite

### Kubernetes Observability Stack (TESTING)
A fully codified observability stack for Kubernetes, including Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards, Loki log aggregation, and Fluent Bit log forwarding.  
Repo: https://github.com/trafik255/k8s-observability-stack


## What I’m Working On

* Building open-source reference implementations for platform engineering and reliability systems
* Enhancing IaC and Kubernetes patterns across personal projects
* Developing cloud-native automation workflows and test orchestration examples
